# kNN & Facial Recognition

## Goal of this project:

This project will - 
  - discuss and develop functions to find Euclidean Distance between data points to find nearest neighbors; 
  - identify the applicability, assumptions, and limitations of the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm;
  - build a Facial Recognition system using the k-NN algorithm;
  - Implement loss functions to compute the accuracy of an algorithm

## Supervised Machine Learning:

Supervised learning is when we have a specific data set and we know exactly what we want to predict. So we want to teach the algorithm to predict a very specific thing.
Supervised machine learning uses inputs, referred to as *features* (`x`), and their corresponding outputs, referred to as *labels* (`y`), to train a function (`h`)
that can predict the label of a previously unseen data point.
